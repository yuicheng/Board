### Introduce

This is a drawing board using OpenGL, allowing users to 
draw lines/rectangles/ellipse/polygons and drag them, 
offering saving/loading project function.

### Compilation

First you need to install OpenGL, if you are compiling in Linux systems, 
just simply clone this repo, using CLion to open its directory and build.

For Windows systems, install freeglutï¼Œ modify CMakeLists.txt:
```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.8)
project(Board)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)

add_executable(Board main.cpp Board.cpp Board.h EShape.cpp EShape.h main.h drawtext.h ELine.cpp ELine.h ERect.cpp ERect.h EEllipse.cpp EEllipse.h EPolygon.cpp EPolygon.h)

target_link_libraries(Board freeglut glu32 opengl32)
```
and then run the building process.
